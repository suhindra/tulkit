        'Lorem ipsum is a long‑lived dummy text used by printers, designers, and front‑end developers to stand in for real copy. It grew out of classical Latin writing, was adopted by typesetters in the 1500s, and later shipped with desktop publishing tools as convenient sample content.',
        'People rely on lorem ipsum because its letters and word lengths resemble natural English, so layouts look realistic without inviting readers to focus on the wording itself. That makes it easier to judge spacing, hierarchy, and visual balance instead of getting distracted by “content here, content here” placeholders.',
        'Although it can look random, the traditional lorem ipsum block is based on passages from Cicero’s “De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum”, trimmed and jumbled over time. Modern generators remix those Latin roots into chunks that feel familiar while avoiding embarrassing or out‑of‑place phrases.',
        'Tulkit’s lorem ipsum generator follows that spirit: it assembles sensible paragraphs from a pool of sentences, lets you pick how much text you need, and keeps a classic “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet…” opening when you want it. Everything runs locally in your browser so you can use it freely in mockups, prototypes, and client work.'
